# Projet_Adaptive_Bayesian_Asset_Allocation_in_Portfolio_Management
Revisiting the Black–Litterman Model with a Multivariate Kalman Filtering Framework
The	objective	of	this	project	is	to	start	from	the	Black–Litterman	model,	which	is	well-suited	for
low-frequency	asset	allocation,	and	extend	its	static	framework	by	introducing	dynamic	features
 through	state-space	modeling	and	Kalman	filtering	techniques.	While	Black–Litterman	provides
 a	solid	Bayesian	foundation	to	combine	equilibrium	returns	with	investor	views,	it	assumes	fixed
 parameters	and	thus	lacks	adaptability	to	evolving	market	conditions.
 By	embedding	a	multivariate	Kalman	filter,	we	aim	to	estimate	time-varying	expected	returns	and
 covariances	in	a	sequential	manner,	capturing	both	long-term	structural	relationships	(e.g.,
 cointegration)	and	short-term	regime	shifts.	This	adaptive	layer	transforms	the	traditional
 Black–Litterman	into	a	dynamic	framework,	where	market	priors,	filtered	signals,	and	subjective
 views	can	be	consistently	integrated.
 The	resulting	methodology	is	expected	to	enhance	portfolio	robustness	by	stabilizing	allocations
 in	normal	conditions,	while	preserving	reactivity	to	structural	breaks	and	transient	shocks.
 Beyond	theoretical	appeal,	this	approach	bridges	the	gap	between	static	Bayesian	allocation
 and	real-world	asset	management,	offering	a	practical	framework	for	dynamic	portfolio
 construction.
 The	final	outcome	will	involve	calibrating	dynamic	portfolio	rotation	strategies	and	implementing
 a	web-based	application	to	materialize	this	proprietary	decision-support	tool.
